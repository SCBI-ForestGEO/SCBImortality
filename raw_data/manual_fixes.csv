The tag number was changed only in mortality census 2017 and Maya and Ryan ID-ed that second stem as being a fram, but the species ID was never changed in the data sets.
# So it seems that the truth would be:

# BUT, after 2018 main census, it seems that instructions were given to Suzanne Lao to change the tag number and species of BOTH stems, instead of the biggest stem only. So tag 33331 disappeared and we ended up with the same issue of having tag 30365 StemTag 1 appearing 2 times (but this time on a fram).
