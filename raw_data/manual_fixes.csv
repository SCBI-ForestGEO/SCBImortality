In 2014 it was found that the biggest stem was actually tagged with tag 30365. The tag number was changed only in mortality census 2017 and Maya and Ryan ID-ed that second stem as being a fram, but the species ID was never changed in the data sets.
# So it seems that the truth would be:
# 33331 1 quru 161.2
# 30365 1 fram 992.0
#
# BUT, after 2018 main census, it seems that instructions were given to Suzanne Lao to change the tag number and species of BOTH stems, instead of the biggest stem only. So tag 33331 disappeared and we ended up with the same issue of having tag 30365 StemTag 1 appearing 2 times (but this time on a fram).
#
# So:
# Long term solution: tell Suzanne that smaller stem is a quru with tag 33331.
